# Project Delta – Survey App (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Two separate forms (Employer & Employee), instant scoring (Payment Readiness Index), and a clean landing page.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Install deps
npm install

# 2) Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Tech
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Notes
- Employer survey computes PRI out of 35 and classifies: Low (0–14), Medium (15–24), High (25–35).
- Employee survey segments respondents: Entry / Mid / High.
- Landing page lets users choose which form to start and return.
